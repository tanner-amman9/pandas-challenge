Inside the PyCitySchool folder you will find my code that ran analysis on the mulitple csv files (which are in the resources folder). I decided to run everything and get the output from the individual cells, as I wasn't sure if all the output was wanted or not. I then also put my written analysis inside the PyCitySchool folder in a ReadMe file.
