After looking over the DataFrames, many things caught my eye. First and foremost I saw that the top 5 schools by overall passing percentage were all charter schools and the bottom 5 schools were all district schools. I think that this shows that the type of school obviously has a major factor on how the schools may teach students overall. A charter school is going to probalby be able to help out a bit more than many district schools may be able to. Secondly I saw that school sizes don't matter too much until the student body becomes larger than 2000 students. There is a dramatic dropoff of overall passing rate from ~90% in student bodies totalling 0-999 students and 1000-2000 students, but then in any schools above 2000 students, the overall passing rate drops all the way down to ~58%. I think that this shows that clearly being a school smaller than 2000 students is extremely important when focusing in on a student's possible success. In conclusions I believe that size of school and type of school are going to dramatically change the odds of a potential student's possible outcomes.
